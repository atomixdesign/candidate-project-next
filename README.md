# Atomix - Trial for Frontend Developers (React, Next and TypeScript)
### Focusing on: React, Next and TypeScript skills

## Introduction
This is the second step in our trial for full-stack web developer role who have opted to go for the NextJS path.\
This trial will test you React, Next and TypeScript skills additionally to the frontend skills tested in the [previous trial](https://github.com/atomixdesign/candidate-project-html-css).

## Trial Instructions
To complete this trial, you can use your existing HTML and CSS code from the previous trial to setup a Next version of this [site design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/9b96df8b-7468-4806-9b66-1a0cd6e30fa4-cec5/). \
Once that is completed, create a `data` folder and setup individual `.json` files for parts of the homepage content and dynamically fetch the JSON data to the Next app.

** Note: We would like to see your TypeScript knowledge as much as possible.

## Getting Started with Create Next App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn install`

Installs the required packages from the `yarn.lock` file.

#### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
